# knot-us
Wedding planning website for my final year project.

Objective:
1. Aimed for users who want to save budget by planning their own wedding instead of hiring wedding planner.
2. Provide curated to do list to guide user on planning their own wedding.

Designed with simplicity in mind, Knot.Us is ideal for those who desire a memorable wedding experience but may lack the expertise or resources to engage a professional wedding planner. Boasting a user-friendly interface, our website provides curated preset to-do lists and budgeting tools, offering a structured roadmap to transform your vision into reality.
